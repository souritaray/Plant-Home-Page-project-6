## What have I learnt in this project?

In this project I have got hands on experience on
- CSS ID Selectors 
- Flexbox

> Note: It is better to make different CSS file rather writing CSS than in `<style>` tag in the head of the HTML document.

## Time required to complete the project

Approximately 2.5 to 3 hours.
